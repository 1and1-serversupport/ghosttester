### Testing Script for the Glibc GHOST Vulnerability # CVE-2015-0235

A little script I found to test the Glibc GHOST Vulnerability # CVE-2015-0235.
The usage is quite simple. Just clone or download the script to your server/desktop and
start it like this:

    gcc ghosttest.c -o ghosttest

or:

    ./ghosttest.c

If your server/desktop is vulnerable you should perform an updata ASAP!
